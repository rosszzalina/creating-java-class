# The Building1

class is a simple representation of a building in Java. It captures essential details such as the building's name, location, height, and number of floors. The class is designed to illustrate the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java, including how to define attributes, create constructors, and implement methods. It also includes a main method for testing its functionality.

## Class Structure
The Building1 class is made up of the following components:

## Attributes:

- name (String): The name of the building, like "Golden Finance 117".
- location (String): The building's location, such as "Shanghai, China".
- height (double): The height of the building in meters.
- numberOfFloors (int): The total number of floors in the building.
- 
## Constructors:

- Parameterized Constructor: This constructor lets you create a Building1 object by specifying values for all attributes.
- Default Constructor: This constructor sets default values like "Unknown Building" for the name and 0 for the number of floors.

## Methods:

- displayInfo() Method: This method prints the building's details in a clear format.
- calculateOccupancy(int peoplePerFloor) Method: This method estimates the buildingâ€™s capacity based on the number of people per floor.
Main Method for Testing: The main method shows how to use the Building1 class. It creates three different building objects and prints their details using displayInfo(). It also demonstrates the calculateOccupancy() method to estimate how many people can occupy the building based on a given number of people per floor.
